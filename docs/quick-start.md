#### First of all, how does it work? {:style="margin-top: 0;"}

When you press `Ctrl + C` Path of Exile copies the item's text (under cursor, if any) to the clipboard.
All that remains is to parse text in Awakened PoE Trade and show to you in a fancy way.

You can set them and change default hotkeys in the [Settings](/faq).

  - Price Check Example
    When Price checking this item:

    This is the Window that appears
    ![](https://imgur.com/HYRmois)
    The checkboxes indicate which mods will be searched for when checking a price.
    Some mods will be grouped together into "pseudo" mods which can be morr easily searched for in poe trade. For example, the spell damage from 3 mods of this wand have been grouped together into one pseudo spell damage mod with a value of all the mods combined.
    The numbers on the side of each mod row indicate the minimum and maximum range to search for when pricing an item. They are automatically populated, but adjusting them manually may get a more accurate price depending on the item.
